Mini Project 1: Menu Driven Billing Calculator Using Python

1. Project Title:
Menu Driven Billing Calculator using Python

2. Problem Statement:
The project aims to design and implement a menu driven billing calculator that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, view the total bill amount, and exit the program.

3. Objective:

To perform basic billing calculations.

To implement menu driven programming.

To understand operators, input, and output.

To apply loops and conditional statements for program control.

4. Tools Used:

Python 3

VS Code / IDLE

5. Description:
This project simulates a simple billing calculator. The user can choose options from a menu to:

Add the cost of items to the bill

Subtract discounts

Multiply item quantities

Divide amounts

Check the total bill

Exit the program

After each operation, the bill amount is updated. This helps the user keep track of the total bill while performing different arithmetic operations interactively.

6. Algorithm:

Initialize the total bill amount.

Display the billing menu.

Read the user’s choice.

If choice is Add, add the amount to the bill.

If choice is Subtract, subtract discount from the bill.

If choice is Multiply, multiply quantity with price.

If choice is Divide, divide the amount as needed.

Display the updated bill amount.

Repeat steps 2–8 until the user chooses to exit.

7. Result:
The menu driven billing calculator performs arithmetic operations correctly and updates the total bill amount as expected.

8. Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how Python can be used to create a simple, interactive billing calculator. It shows practical use of basic operators, input/output handling, loops, and conditional statements in a real-world application scenario.
